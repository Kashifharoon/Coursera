    "## Capstone: Find the best neighborhood in Toronto to open a Restaurant Supply Store\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine who runs a leading Restaurant Supply Store has found out that I am studying data science and has asked for help in trying to determine which neighborhood in Toronto he should open his new store in.\n",
    "Example Company:\n",
    "http://www.bramainc.com/about-brama\n",
    "I begin with an interview with my friend to determine the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which neighborhood should my friend open his new Restaurant Supply store in Toronto?\n",
    "He wants to ensure steady and sustainable business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store needs to be strategically located inside the biggest concentration of restaurants in Toronto area.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Confirm any assumption by means of modeling and testing the data. Specifically, visually cluster common restaurants in Toronto by neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Additionally determine that a good number people can frequent these restaurants with sustainable frequency inside these neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "a.) Is the neighborhood populous?\n",
    "\n",
    "b.) Is the neighborhood average salary close to the Canadian National Average?\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend wants to be able to judge which neighborhoods also may be poised to grow in restaurant numbers in coming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locating his new store according to these requirements will ensure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "lowest cost for delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "shortest travel time to his store for his clients\n",
    "\n",
    "overall lower run costs\n",
    "\n",
    "increase in overall business\n",
    "\n",
    "overall greater customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow along in my Capstone Notebook located here:\n",
    "https://github.com/dcrouch1/Peer-graded-Assignment-Capstone-Project---The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-Week-2-/blob/master/Daves_Capstone.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of hard work went into creating the working data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to combine the following disparate data sources. The order of events went like this\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load all the Data from all the various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Toronto neighborhoods broken down by postal code\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "Here I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the wiki page to extract a working list of Toronto Neighborhoods sorted by postal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.1 Load Toronto geospatial coordinates and merge to Toronto Postal Code Data\n",
    "\n",
    "http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I joined geo spatial to the Toronto Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Toronto neighborhoods populations broken down by postal code\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Tables/File.cfm?T=1201&SR=1&RPP=9999&PR=0&CMA=0&CSD=0&S=22&O=A&Lang=Eng&OFT=CSV\n",
    "Use Pandas to grab the csv\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2.1 Merge Toronto Neighbourhood populations data with Toronto Postal Code data\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I joined population data to the Toronto Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Toronto neighborhoods average after tax income broken down by postal code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we must manually download these from Stats Canada and load them.\n",
    "https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/search-recherche/change-geo.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FSA\n",
    "See: to_geo_space.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3.1 Merge Toronto Neighbourhood income data with Toronto Postal Code data\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I joined income data to the Toronto Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time I also saved a copy of the data set as my friend had asked for it in his list of requirements.\n",
    "See: TO_Affluence.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 What is the Canadian National Average After Tax Income\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I must also manually download this from Stats Canada and load them.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180313/dq180313a-eng.htm\n",
    "Canadian families and unattached individuals had a median after-tax income of $57,000 in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observation: Of the 103 Toronto Neighborhoods gathered only 55.3% or 57 Neighborhoods are above the median after-tax income. 37.8% or 39 Neighborhoods are below he median after-tax income. 6.7% or 7 neighborhoods did not register as it appears their populations are too low. It appears that the greatest concentration of affluence is near central Toronto. We decided to keep all neighborhoods in the dataset regardless of income of population as the majority were close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5 Toronto list of Restaurants or Venues that could potentially use Restaurant Equipment\n",
    "4SQUARE API\n",
    "https://api.foursquare.com\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5.1 Get all the Venues in Toronto.\n",
    "1.5.2 Only add Restaurants as Venue Categories\n",
    "Use this list to Extract Restaurants and only include Restaurants in our Data Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5.3 OneHot encode and count restaurants\n",
    "Prepare the data for clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine all of those into a working Data Set to cluster and geo spatial map of the results showing the best neighborhood to open a Restaurant Supply Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all of these disparate data sets will clearly demonstrate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "which neighborhoods in Toronto have clusters of like Restaurants\n",
    "how populated each neighborhoods is\n",
    "the average after tax income is all of these neighborhoods\n",
    "which neighborhood should he target to open his new store."
